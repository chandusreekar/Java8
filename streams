1. Streams
2. Hands-on Streams
3. Logical practice question
4. DataMunging Assignment-2


Streams:
 - sequence of elements/objects  from a data source like collections, arrays.
 - do operations on the data  eg: sorting, filtering ,agregations 

 
 Intermediate Operations
 - do not close the stream
 - perform the operations and return a new stream or the same stream
 - chained/pipelined
 
 filter(Prediacte)
 map - transform the data in the stream
 sorting
 
 Terminal Operations
 - close the stream
 
 forEach
 reduce=> (2,4,6,7)max,sum, count
 collect - Collectors
 toArray
 matching
 finding - findAny, findFirst
 
 
 How are we going to work with Streams
 - create a stream from a datasource
 - apply intermediate operations
 - apply terminal operations to close the stream
